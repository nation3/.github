# Nation3 Contributing Guidelines

A document with pragmatic standards and best-practices used by Nation3 developers.

## Pull Requests

After creating a pull request, assign one of the Nation3 [teams](https://github.com/orgs/nation3/teams) as reviewers.

When you have 2 approved reviews, merge the pull request.

## Code Syntax/Formatting

### TypeScript/JavaScript

We use [ESLint](https://eslint.org) as a linter, and [Prettier](https://prettier.io) to automatically format code so it adheres to our coding style.
Default config files for both can be seen [here](https://github.com/nation3/app/blob/main/ui/.eslintrc) and [here](https://github.com/nation3/app/blob/main/ui/.prettierrc.json). It is recommended to use Prettier inside your development environment to format your code with the right coding style on the fly.
